# The World Is All About Functions
The beauty of mathematics lies in its concise function, a formula, with simple form but has the power to illustrate a bunch of life issues.

1. Guass method for linear equations solving.
2. LU decomposition (where 'LU' stands for 'lower upper') factors a matrix as the product of lower triangular matrix and upper triangular matrix.
3. Newton Method is a numerical way to solve linear equations that are successive differentiable at its zero points.
4. Secant method for equation solving is an application of Newton iteration formula.
5. Analysis of variance for equation solving is a collection of statistical models used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures. This demo presents a single factor analysis of variance.
