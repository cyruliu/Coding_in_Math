These parograms include the basic mathematical algorithms, which are usually used in computaional mathematics, the details are as follow:
 1, Guass method for equations solving;
 2, LU decomposition(where 'LU' stands for 'lower upper')factors a matrix as the product of lower triangular matrix and upper triangular matrix.
 3, Newton method is a numerical way to solve linear equaltions which are successive differentiable at its zero points.
 4, Secant method for equation solving is a application of Newton iteration formula.
 5, ...
